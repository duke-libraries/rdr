This README file contains all associated metadata for the dataset and a description
of the files packaged with the data export.


==DATA EXPORT==

All data packages exported from the Duke Research Data Repository (RDR) will be arranged
according to the Library of Congress BagIt specification for disk-based
storage and network transfer of digital content.

A "bag" consists of a "payload" (the content) and "tags", which are metadata files
intended to document the storage and transfer of the bag. Data packages downloaded
from the RDR will contain:

  - a "data" directory that contains the files and content associated with the dataset

  - a "bag-info.txt" file which details metadata for the bag, including the date
  the bag was compiled

  - a "bagit.txt" file that identifies the directory as a bag, the version of the
  BagIt specification that it adheres to, and the character encoding used for tag files

  - 2 manifest files that itemize the files in the "data" directory along with their
  checksums--"manifest-md5.txt" lists checksums calculated with the MD5 algorithm,
  "manifest-sha1.txt" lists checksums calculated using the SHA-1 algorithm

  - 2 tag manifest files, which list checksums for the tag files enumerated above
